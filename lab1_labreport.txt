1.) How could you copy all the files from the current directory to its parent directory?

        cp /home/student/currentdirectoryname/* /home/student
            

2.) How could you move all the files that end with an extension *.h in your home directory to the current directory
    without knowing the full path to the current directory?

        By using the shorthand notation for current directory and home directory i.e.
        mv ~/*.h .

3.) Write a command sequence to make a directory called 'backup' underneath the current directory, then copy all the
    files in the current directory to 'backup'.
    
        mkdir backup
        cp /home/student/currentdirectoryname/* /home/student/currentdirectoryname/backup
        
4.) If a program becomes unresponsive, what two Linux commands could you use to indentify the faulty program
    number and terminate it?
    
        You can use ps to see all the processes currently running and find the faulty program number then use the 
        kill command along with the faulty program number to kill that particular program 
        
5.) When you ran grep, the version of Ubuntu you're currently running was listed. What version is it?

        Ubutntu 16.04.7 LTS 
        This information is in the /etc/os-release directory
